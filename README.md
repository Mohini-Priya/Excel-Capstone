# Retail Chain Delivery Data Analysis

## 📝 Project Overview

This capstone project analyzes the end-to-end order and delivery data for a retail chain in HSR, Bangalore, which started a home delivery service in 2021. The analysis uncovers patterns in customer behavior, operational efficiency, and overall delivery performance using transaction-level data.

Through a detailed exploration, the project provides business insights such as delivery performance by time slots, order completion rates, customer lifetime value (LTV), and delivery cost patterns. It also identifies high-demand locations, customer acquisition sources, and slot-based delivery efficiencies to support decision-making and improve service delivery.
